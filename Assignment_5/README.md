# Mounting the Google Drive Locally and accessing the project files
   The local google drive will be mounted to colab and the files in the drive directory is executed.
# Import the python file
   From the local directory we are importing the Model.py file to the colab.
## Model.py
This file is imported by S5.ipnb file.In the model file we will be downloading the MNIST dataset from torch and we prepare the test and train dataset.
    After preparaing the dataset we train the model. The Net class will create all the layers.
- The convolution layers
- The max pooling layers
- The activation layers 
- The fully connected layers

Here we train the model and also test the model.Then the prediction accuracy is calculated
